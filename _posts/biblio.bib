  abstract      = "Numerous data mining techniques have been developed to
                   extract information and identify patterns and predict trends
                   from large data sets. In this study, two classification
                   techniques, the J48 implementation of the C4.5 algorithm and
                   a Naive Bayes classifier are applied to predict lung cancer
                   survivability from an extensive data set with fifteen years
                   of patient records. The purpose of the project is to verify
                   the predictive effectiveness of the two techniques on real,
                   historical data. Besides the performance outcome that
                   renders J48 marginally better than the Naive Bayes
                   technique, there is a detailed description of the data and
                   the required pre-processing activities. The performance
                   results confirm expectations while some of the issues that
                   appeared during experimentation, underscore the value of
                   having domain-specific understanding to leverage any
                   domain-specific characteristics inherent in the data.",
